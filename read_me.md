This python code (code.py) takes the data from input files (test.csv, train.csv, sample.csv) and trains it on a Random Forest Classifier and produces a predicted output.csv. 

To run it, type in terminal -> python3 code.py

To run for N5C5 -> Edit 'N' in code.py to 5
To run for N10C10 -> Edit 'N' in code.py to 10
To run for N15C15 -> Edit 'N' in code.py to 15

The code generates three set of features. Two are used in generation of the output.
Feature 1 - Composition (adding 20 columns)
Feature 2 - Dipeptide composition (adding 400 columns)
Feature 3 - mass, charge, pi (adding 3 columns) (not used)
